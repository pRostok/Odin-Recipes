            <h3 class="title">Directions</h3>
            <ol class="info">
                <li>Place the peaches, honey, and peach schnapps into a saucepan over medium heat, and cook until the peaches are softened
                and the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Stir in sugar and cinnamon until combined. Stir in the
                flour, and bring the mixture back to a simmer. Simmer until the flour has thickened the filling, 10 to 15 minutes.
                Remove from heat, transfer filling to a container, and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stretch bottom pie crust into a 9 1/2-inch pie pan; cut the other crust into 1-inch wide strips. Spread the peach
                filling evenly into the bottom crust, and make a lattice crust from the strips, weaving the strips over and under each
                other. Pinch strips to the bottom crust at both ends.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, then remove and cover the crust edges with foil strips. Return
                to oven and bake until top crust is golden brown, about 30 more minutes. Cool on wire rack at least 2 hours before
                serving to allow pie filling to set up.</li>
            </ol>
